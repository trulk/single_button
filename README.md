# single_button
Demo application using a single button interface made in Godot.

# Builds
There is nothing worth exporting where the project stands currently. Once there is a user interface that can navigate in and out of a demo, you will likely find it on this page.

# Useage
Place the single_button folder from the projects-files branch into wherever you keep your godot projects. Then scan it at the Projects List window within godot to load it as a project.
You can adapt the contents from this project to your own if you need to produce complex actions from a binary input.
